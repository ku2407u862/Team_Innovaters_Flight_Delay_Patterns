We all have done alot of discussion and then did our project (we have tried to distribute the work equally amoung us without any chaos),

The below given data is the details of our contribution:-

Jaival Kansara - data collection and prepared the dataset (used kaggle),
Sameer Chauhan - wrote the whole source code in python idle (also uploaded to GitHub),
Milap Dorawala - collected the information on traffic through different platforms,
Kasimali Kadiwala - finalised the tools we have used and ensure the correct libararies used,
Mokshil  Shah - made the README.md (which had all information).


Looking forward for some more intresting projects like this  :>
